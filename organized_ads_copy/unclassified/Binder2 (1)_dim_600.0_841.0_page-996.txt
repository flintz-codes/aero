2. Spares Affected
None.
B. Concurrent Requirements
None.
C. Reason
The changes provided in this service bulletin will help prevent damage to the low pressure oxygen flex
hoses that may be subjected to electrical current. If the change in this service bulletin is not done, an
electrical grounding condition can result, causing the hose to melt or burn and release smoke and/or
fire into the flight compartment.
One operator has reported damaged oxygen supply hoses on another Boeing model in August of 1997.
This damage has occurred due to a short circuit in the 757 Audio Select Panel. It sent an electrical
current through the support structure to the flight crew oxygen mask stowage box. This caused the
spring inside the low pressure oxygen hose to act as an electrical conductor and heat up. This caused
the hose to burn through.
Also, a similar occurrence on a 737 was reported due to improper maintenance.
This service bulletin will replace low pressure oxygen hoses with non-conductive hoses located on the
flight deck.
Revision 1 is sent to advise affected operators of the following:
