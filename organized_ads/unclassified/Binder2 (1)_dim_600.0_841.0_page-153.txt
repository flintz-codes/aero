SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA received several reports indicating
that operators found loose nuts on the bolts that connect the lower input crank
arm and the vernier adjustment input rod of the elevator power control unit (PCU).
Apparently. maintenance had not been accomplished on the PCU's since delivery
of the airplanes from the manufacturer. One of the loose PCU input rod nuts was
found on a production airplane during a line check. The loose nuts reported had
been finger tightened. but had not been properly torqued on the bolts.
Locse nuts on the bolts of the input rod of the elevator PCU could result in the
loss of pivot bolts on the crank arms of the elevator PCU's and consequent loss
of control of the airplane during takeoff and landing.
Explanation of Relevant Service Information
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Telegraphic Service Letter 737-SL-
27-150. dated February 14. 2000, which describes procedures for a one-time
visual inspection to determine if the nuts installed on the bolts at each end of the
input rods connected to each elevator power control unit (PCU) are installed
correctly. and tightening of any loose nut that is found
Explanation of the Requirements of the Rule
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on
other Boeing Model 737-600, -700, and -800 series airplanes of the same type
design. this AD is being issued to prevent loss of control of the airplane during
takeoff and landing due to loose nuts on the bolts of the input crank arms of the
elevator PCU. and consequent loss of pivot bolts on the PCU This AD requires a
one-time general visual inspection to determine if the nuts installed on the bolts at
each end of the input rods connected to each elevator PCU are installed correctly
