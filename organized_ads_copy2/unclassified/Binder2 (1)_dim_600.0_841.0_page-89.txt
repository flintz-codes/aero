Preamble Information
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT
ACTION: Final rule: request for comments
SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 737 series airplanes. This action requires
repetitive inspections and functional tests of a trailing edge flap limit switch to
verify proper operation, and replacement of the existing limit switch with a new
limit switch, if necessary. This AD also requires modification of the stabilizer
control system, which constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections
and tests. This amendment is prompted by reports of uncommanded stabilizer
trim motion due to failure of the trailing edge flap limit switch. The actions
specified in this AD are intended to prevent such failure, which could result in
uncommanded (nose down) stabilizer trim motion and consequent reduced
controllability of the airplane.
DATES: Effective May 27. 1999.
The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is
approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 27, 1999.
Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July
12, 1999.
