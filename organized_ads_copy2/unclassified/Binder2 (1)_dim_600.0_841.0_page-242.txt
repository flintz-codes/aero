installed in "sensitive" or "non-sensitive" applications.
The FAA concurs with the commenters' request for clarification. This AD is
intended to apply only to the valves in locations listed in the referenced service
bulletins--that is, valves in "sensitive" applications. The FAA has revised
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD accordingly and added a new note, Note 1, after
the applicability statement to clarify this issue. (Subsequent notes have also been
reordered.)
Operators should note that, while the airplane manufacturer will issue new service
bulletins with instructions for replacing valves in "non-sensitive" applications on
the affected airplanes, at this time, the FAA does not plan to mandate replacing
these valves.
Request To Reference New Service Information
Several operators request that the FAA revise the proposed AD to reference new
service bulletins issued by Boeing.
The FAA concurs with the commenters' request and--since the issuance of the
supplemental NPRM--has reviewed and approved the following 10 new service
bulletins:
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-29A1073. Revision 3. including Appendices A
and B, dated December 2. 1999: This service bulletin revises Boeing Service
Bulletin 737-29A1073, Revision 2, dated July 1. 1999. which was referenced as
an appropriate source of service information in the supplemental NPRM. Revision
3 describes procedures for repetitive operational checks of certain motor-operated
hydraulic shutoff valves to detect malfunctioning on certain Boeing Model 737-
100, -200, -300. -400. and -500 series airplanes. The procedures in this bulletin
are essentially similar to those in Revision 2; however, this service bulletin
removes all Boeing Model 737-600, 737-700, and 737-800 series airplanes from
the effectivity listing. (Boeing Model 737-600, -700, and -800 series airplanes
have been included in a new service bulletin, which is described below.) This
service bulletin also references a new service bulletin, described below, that
describes replacement of the subject valves with new, improved valves, which
ends the need for the repetitive operational checks.
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-29A1081. including Appendices A and B. dated
December 2. 1999: This service bulletin describes procedures for repetitive
operational checks of certain motor-operated hydraulic shutoff valves to detect
malfunctioning on certain Boeing Model 737-600, 737-700. and 737-800 series
airplanes. These procedures are essentially the same as those described in
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-29A1073, Revision 2, for these airplanes. This
service bulletin also references a new service bulletin, described below, that
describes replacement of the subject valves with new, improved valves, which
ends the need for the repetitive operational checks.
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 757-29A0048. Revision 3, including Appendices A
and B, dated December 2, 1999: This service bulletin revises Boeing Service
Bulletin 757-29A0048, Revision 2. dated July 1. 1999, which was referenced as
