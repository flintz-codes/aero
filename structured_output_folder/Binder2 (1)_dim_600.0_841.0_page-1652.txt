2012-23-08 The Boeing Company: Amendment 39-17264; Docket No. FAA-2012-0591;
Directorate Identifier 2012-NM-015-AD.
(a) Effective Date
This airworthiness directive (AD) is effective December 31, 2012.
(b) Affected ADs
This AD supersedes AD 2008-08-24, Amendment 39-15478 (73 FR 21242, April 21, 2008).
(c) Applicability
(1) This AD applies to The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -
900ER series airplanes, certificated in any category, as identified in Boeing Special Attention Service
Bulletin 737-54-1043, Revision 2, dated November 4, 2011.
(2) Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) ST00830SE
(http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgstc.nsf/0/408E012E008616A7862578880060
456C?OpenDocument&Highlight=st00830se) does not affect the ability to accomplish the actions
required by this AD. Therefore, for airplanes on which STC ST00830SE is installed, a "change in
product" alternative method of compliance (AMOC) approval request is not necessary to comply with
the requirements of 14 CFR 39.17. For all other AMOC requests, the operator must request approval
for an AMOC in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (h) of this AD.
(d) Subject
Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC)/Air Transport Association (ATA) of America Code
54, Nacelles/pylons.
(e) Unsafe Condition
This AD was prompted by a report of a broken drain tube assembly on the aft fairing of the left
engine strut at the clamp support location under the aft fairing compartment, inside the heat shield
cavity of the aft fairing. There have also been reports of tube wear at the clamp location on additional
airplanes. We are issuing this AD to prevent failure of the drain tube assemblies and clamps on the aft
fairings of the engine struts. Such failure could allow leaked flammable fluids in the drain systems to
discharge onto the heat shields of the aft fairings of the engine struts, which could result in an
undetected and uncontrollable fire.
(f) Compliance
Comply with this AD within the compliance times specified, unless already done.
