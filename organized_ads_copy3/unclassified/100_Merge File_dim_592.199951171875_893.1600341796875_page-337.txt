Procedure
Ref. Fig. Main Gear Wheel
NOTE:
If the wheel has a pressure-sensor seal cap, make sure that the
N/A
seal cap is correctly installed and safetied with a nut and a cotter
pin.
NOTE: Because of the aircraft configuration, the installation of the Tire
Pressure Indicating System (TPIS) balance weight changes: If the
aircraft has the TPIS and the Brake Cooling Fan (BCF)/Universal
Brake Cooling Fan (UBCF), no TPIS balance weight is installed on
the wheel rim. The balance weight is part of the BCF/UBCF
assembly (brake-fan shroud support), refer to the BCF/UBCF
N/A
Component Maintenance Manual (CMM). If the aircraft has the TPIS
only (no BCF/UBCF): * On the A321 aircraft, you must install the
TPIS balance weight on the wheel rim, refer to the wheel CMM. *
On the A318-A319-A320 aircraft, you must install the TPIS balance
weight on the hubcap, refer to the hubcap CMM. If the aircraft has
no TPIS, no TPIS balance weight is necessary.
